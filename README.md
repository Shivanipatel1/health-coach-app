# health-coach-app
my android project
•	Developed BY-  Shivani Patel
•	Gyan Ganga Institute of Technology and Science

## Introduction

•	The motive behind to develop the Health Coach App is that :-
•	It can help people to calculate their health wellness by calculating their body mass index.
•	This app is beneficial for everybody from a child to an elder , But it will be more beneficial for elders whose age is more than 55 , as the changes in their weight and  body occurs more frequently when they are not healthy .
•	Some elders can have Severe Obesity , this app will guide them what to do in such condition. As obesity is the leading problem for many new deceases like heart problems , blood pressure and joint pain.
•	Some elders can have severe thinness ,which can make their body weak so this app will guide them in such condition. 

## Methodology  of  the project

•	This  android application is developed in the Java language in android studio.
•	First step is to download android studio and sdk files .
•	Second and most important step is to download emulator for running our app.
•	After this I have chosen number of activities our android app will contain .
•	These are :- Splash screen
•	Home screen
•	BMI result screen
•	Next page (exercise list page will be created afterwards ).
•	Near by Doctors search page (will be created afterwards).

## Splash Screen

The splash screen contains a Motivation quote , a logo and the name of the application.
It has 3 seconds of delay to prevent the technical lag issues.

## Home Screen Page

•	After the delay of 3 seconds , the home page opens up which is the main page of our application.
•	The Xml file contains layout code of our app , and the java file contains the working activities .
•	The page consist of many options like Select your gender , age , weight , height etc .
•	It also has a on click button which enables us to see the result .

 ## BMI result page

This page consist of a image view for logo , some text views and and a on click button for recalculating the BMI. Or we can say it redirects us to the  home page .
  
## App Icon
•	The app is about health so I have chosen a doctors icon as application’s icon.
•	Icon is the first thing by which we recognize and find our app .

## Some more important codes
•	menifest file contains all the information of our app including name ,icon etc.
 
## Build.gradle
•	It contains all the important dependencies which are really important for our app.

 ## Future expansion of the app

•	The major part of the app is completed successfully ,and it is working very nicely in the virtual device as well as in the real mobile phone .
•	But  I have decided to include 2 more activities in near future which are :-
•	List of exercise page .
•	Near by Doctors search page .
